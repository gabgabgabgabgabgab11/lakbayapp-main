        <h2>🚍 Real-Time Jeepney Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Lakbay is a cutting-edge mobile platform designed specifically for the Philippine jeepney system. 
          Unlike generic navigation apps, we focus exclusively on tracking public utility jeepneys (PUJs) in real-time, 
          giving you accurate information about nearby jeepneys, their routes, and estimated arrival times.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more waiting at uncertain stops wondering when your ride will arrive. With Lakbay, you'll know exactly 
          where the nearest jeepney is and when it will reach your location.
